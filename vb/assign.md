Variational Inference for Topic Models
=

Due: 17. Nov 2017

Overview
--------

In this homework you'll explore the implementation of various variational parameter updates for
Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

You'll turn in your code on ELMS.  This assignment is worth 30
points.

What you have to do
----

Coding:

1.  Given a beta parameter and a gamma vector, compute the variational parameter
    *phi* for a given word by implementing the *new phi* function.
1.  Given word counts, update the probability of a word given a topic in the m
    step of variational inference in the *m step* function.

Analysis:

1.  Run a topic model on the supplied AP data (data/ap) and turn the resulting
    topic file (topics.txt)

Extra Credit:

1. Implement the *update alpha* function 
2. Use cross-validation on the test set to select the alpha that provides the best ELBO.  Does this give the same result as updating alpha via ELBO on the training set?

What to turn in
-

1.  Submit your _lda.py_ file
2.  Submit your _topics.txt_ file
3.  Submit your _analysis.pdf_ file for extra credit. 

Unit Tests
=

I've provided unit tests based on the example that we worked through in class.
Before running your code on read data, make sure it passes all of the unit
tests.  However, these tests are not exhaustive; passing the tests will not
guarantee a good grade, you should verify yourself that your code is robust and
correct.


Hints
-

1.  Test that you can correctly run your code on the toy data before even trying
    the AP data.
1.  It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to run on the AP data.  If it's much
    slower than that, you probably did something inefficient in your code.
1.  Don't submit your topics without looking at it first.  It should have topics
    that make sense.  If not, then there's something wrong with your code.
    Here's an example of some of my topics with the default settings of the
    code (10 topics):
